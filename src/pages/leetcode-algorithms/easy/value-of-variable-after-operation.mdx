<Tags array={["# Array"]} />

There is a programming language with only **four** operations and **one** variable `X`:
- `++X` and `X++` **increments** the value of `X` by `1`.
- `--X` and `X--` **decrements** the value of `X` by `1`.

Initially the value of `X` is `0`.

Given an array of strings **operations** containing a list of operations, return the final value of `X` _after performing all the operations_.
